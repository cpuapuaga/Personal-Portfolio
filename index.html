        <h2>About...</h2>
        <p id="bio">I’m Caleb and I am currently Senior studying Computer 
            Science at the University of Puget Sound. I was born 
            in Hawaii, but moved to Washington State in 2007 and 
            have been a Washingtonian ever since. I love all things 
            regarding music and sports, as I currently work part-time 
            as a Live Audio-Engineer as well as play for my university’s 
            football program. I plan to finish up my undergraduate degree 
            this Fall, and begin to look for internships to start building 
            experience in the work force.
